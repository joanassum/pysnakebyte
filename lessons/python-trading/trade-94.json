They profit from the difference, provided the market doesn't trend strongly against them.\n\n### Inventory Risk\n\nIf you buy BTC and price crashes, you lose money despite the spread. You must manage \"Inventory Skew\" by adjusting your prices to offload excess inventory.\n\n### Strategy\n\n1.  Calculate fair price (mid-price of order book).\n2.  Place Bid at `Fair - Spread/2`.\n3.  Place Ask at `Fair + Spread/2`.\n4.  Update orders frequently (every few seconds).",
