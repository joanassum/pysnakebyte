  "content": "# Types of Orders\n\nWhen your algorithm decides to trade, it must send a specific order type to the broker.\n\n## 1. Market Order\n*   **Execute immediately** at the best available current price.\n*   **Risk**: Slippage (Price might change before execution).\n*   **Use case**: Need to get in/out NOW.\n\n## 2. Limit Order\n*   Buy or sell only at a **specific price or better**.\n*   **Risk**: Order might never be filled if price doesn't reach your limit.\n*   **Use case**: Entering at a specific technical level.\n\n## 3. Stop Order (Stop-Loss)\n*   Becomes a market order once a specific price (Stop Price) is reached.\n*   **Use case**: Protecting against downside risk.\n\n## 4. Stop-Limit Order\n*   Becomes a limit order once the stop price is hit.",
