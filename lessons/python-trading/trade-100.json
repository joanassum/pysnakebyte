  "content": "## Ranging Markets\n\nGrid trading profits from normal market noise in a sideways market. It requires no prediction of direction.\n\n### Mechanism\n\n1.  Define a range (e.g., $100 - $110).\n2.  Place buy orders at $100, $102, $104...\n3.  Place sell orders at $106, $108, $110...\n4.  When a buy executes at $102, place a corresponding sell at $104 to lock in profit.\n\n### Risk\n\nIf price leaves the range (trends strongly), you are left with \"bag holding\" (price drops) or missed opportunity (price skyrockets).",
