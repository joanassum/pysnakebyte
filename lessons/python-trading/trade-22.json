  "content": "# Exponential Moving Average (EMA)\n\nThe EMA places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points. It reacts more significantly to recent price changes than a simple moving average (SMA).\n\n## Calculation\n`EMA_today = (Value_today * (Smoothing / (1 + Days))) + EMA_yesterday * (1 - (Smoothing / (1 + Days)))`\n\n## Why use EMA?\n*   Less lag than SMA.\n*   Better for identifying short-term trend reversals.",
