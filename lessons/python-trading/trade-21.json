  "content": "# Simple Moving Average (SMA)\n\nThe SMA is the unweighted mean of the previous `k` data points. It smooths out price action to identify the trend direction.\n\n## Calculation\n`SMA = (P1 + P2 + ... + Pk) / k`\n\n## Interpretation\n*   **Trend Following**: If Price > SMA, the trend is up.\n*   **Support/Resistance**: SMAs often act as dynamic support levels.\n*   **Lag**: SMAs lag current prices because they are based on past data.",
