They use algos to minimize market impact.\n\n### TWAP (Time Weighted)\n\nSimple: Divide order size by N time intervals. Execute slice every T minutes.\n\n### VWAP (Volume Weighted)\n\nComplex: Estimate volume profile for the day (e.g., \"U\" shape). Execute more when market is active. Compare your execution price against the market VWAP benchmark.",
