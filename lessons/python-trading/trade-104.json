A scanner finds these opportunities in real-time.\n\n### Architecture\n\n1.  **Connectors**: Async websocket connections to 5+ exchanges.\n2.  **Normalizer**: Standardize symbol names (BTC-USD vs XBT/USD).\n3.  **Aggregator**: Maintain a \"Global Best Bid/Offer\" (GBBO).\n4.  **Alerter**: If (Best Bid @ Ex A) > (Best Ask @ Ex B) + Fees -> Alert.\n\n### Challenges\n\nTransferring fiat/crypto between exchanges takes time (block confirmations). True arb usually requires holding inventory on both.",
