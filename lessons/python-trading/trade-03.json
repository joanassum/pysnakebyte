The standard format for bar data.\n*   **Tick Data**: Every single trade executed.\n*   **Fundamental Data**: Earnings, revenue, P/E ratios.\n*   **Alternative Data**: Satellite imagery, sentiment analysis.\n\n## Sources\n\n1.  **Yahoo Finance (`yfinance`)**: Free, easy to use, good for daily data. Not for HFT.\n2.  **Alpha Vantage**: Free tier API.\n3.  **IEX Cloud**: specific API for financial data.\n4.  **Interactive Brokers**: For live trading and professional data.\n\nWe will use `yfinance` for this course as it requires no API key for basic usage.",
