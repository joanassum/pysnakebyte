  "content": "## Regression vs. Classification\n\nWhile classification predicts direction (Up/Down), regression attempts to predict the specific future value or return. This is often harder due to the noise in financial data.\n\n### Linear Regression & Beyond\n\nSimple linear regression is often too simple for complex market dynamics. We often use:\n- **Ridge/Lasso Regression**: To handle multicollinearity and prevent overfitting.\n- **SVR (Support Vector Regression)**: For non-linear relationships.\n\n### Evaluation Metrics\n\n- **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**: Average squared difference.\n- **R-squared**: Goodness of fit (often very low in finance).\n- **Information Coefficient (IC)**: Correlation between predicted and actual returns.",
