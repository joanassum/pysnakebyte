  "content": "## Speed Matters\n\nNetwork latency and processing time can change a winning strategy into a losing one.\n\n### Latency Sources\n\n1.  **Network**: Distance to exchange servers. Co-location (renting servers near the exchange) is used by HFT.\n2.  **Processing**: Python is slower than C++. Minimize heavy loops in the critical path.\n\n### Slippage\n\nThe difference between expected price and fill price. High volatility or low liquidity increases slippage.\n\n### Mitigation\n\n- Use Limit Orders instead of Market Orders.\n- Account for slippage in backtests (add a friction cost).\n- Optimize code (profile using `cProfile`).",
