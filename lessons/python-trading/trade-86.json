Execution algos break orders down.\n\n### Common Order Types\n\n- **Market**: Execute immediately at best price.\n- **Limit**: Execute at specific price or better.\n- **Stop Loss / Take Profit**: Triggers when price hits a level.\n\n### Execution Algorithms\n\n- **TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price)**: Slice order evenly over time.\n- **VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price)**: Slice order based on historical volume profiles.\n- **Iceberg**: Show only a small tip of the total order size to the market.",
