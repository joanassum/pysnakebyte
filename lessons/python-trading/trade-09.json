  "content": "# Trading Costs and Slippage\n\nNew algorithmic traders often fail because they ignore costs. A strategy that makes 1% profit but costs 1.5% in fees is a losing strategy.\n\n## Components of Cost\n\n1.  **Commissions**: Fee paid to broker per trade or per share.\n2.  **Spread**: The difference between the Bid (highest buyer) and Ask (lowest seller). You usually buy at Ask and sell at Bid.\n3.  **Slippage**: The difference between the expected price of a trade and the price at which the trade is executed. High in fast-moving markets or with large orders.\n\n## Modeling Costs\nIn backtesting, always add a penalty for costs.\n\n`Net Profit = Gross Profit - (Commissions + Slippage + Spread)`",
