Can be Code cells or Markdown cells.\n\n## Basic Shortcuts\n\n*   `Shift + Enter`: Run the current cell and select the next one.\n*   `Ctrl + Enter`: Run the selected cell.\n*   `A`: Insert cell above.\n*   `B`: Insert cell below.\n*   `M`: Change cell to Markdown.\n*   `Y`: Change cell to Code.\n\n## Magic Commands\n\nJupyter provides \"magic commands\" that start with `%`. For example, `%timeit` times the execution of a Python statement.",
