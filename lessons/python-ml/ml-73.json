  "content": "## Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n\nSupport Vector Machines are powerful supervised learning algorithms used for classification and regression. The goal of SVM is to find a hyperplane that best separates the classes with the maximum margin.\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n*   **Hyperplane**: The decision boundary that separates classes.\n*   **Support Vectors**: Data points closest to the hyperplane that influence its position.\n*   **Margin**: The distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data point from either class. SVM maximizes this margin.\n*   **Kernel Trick**: Allows SVM to solve non-linear problems by transforming data into a higher-dimensional space where it becomes linearly separable. Common kernels: Linear, Polynomial, RBF (Radial Basis Function).\n\n### C and Gamma Hyperparameters\n\n*   **C**: Regularization parameter. Small C = wider margin but more misclassifications (soft margin). Large C = narrower margin, fewer misclassifications (hard margin).\n*   **Gamma**: Defines how far the influence of a single training example reaches. High Gamma = close points have high weight.\n\n### Implementation\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\n\n# Linear Kernel\nsvm_linear = SVC(kernel='linear', C=1.0)\n\n# RBF Kernel (default)\nsvm_rbf = SVC(kernel='rbf', C=1.0, gamma='scale')\n\nsvm_rbf.fit(X_train, y_train)\n```\n",
