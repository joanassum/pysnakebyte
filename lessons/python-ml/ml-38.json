  "content": "## A/B Testing Fundamentals\n\nA/B testing (or split testing) is a method of comparing two versions of a variable to determine which one performs better. In Data Science, it is the gold standard for causal inference in product changes.\n\n### The Process\n\n1.  **Hypothesis**: Define a null hypothesis ($H_0$) and an alternative hypothesis ($H_1$).\n2.  **Split**: Randomly assign users to a Control group (A) and a Treatment group (B).\n3.  **Measure**: Collect data on the primary metric (e.g., conversion rate).\n4.  **Test**: Perform a statistical test (like a t-test or z-test) to calculate a p-value.\n5.  **Decision**: If $p < \\alpha$ (usually 0.05), reject $H_0$ and conclude the change had an effect.\n\n### Key Metrics\n\n- **Conversion Rate**: Proportion of users taking action.\n- **Lift**: Percentage increase in the metric.\n- **P-value**: Probability of observing the result if $H_0$ were true.\n",
