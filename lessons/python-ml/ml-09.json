It avoids the need to explicitly create copies of data.\n\n## The Broadcasting Rule\n\nTwo dimensions are compatible when:\n1.  They are equal, or\n2.  One of them is 1.\n\nIf these conditions are not met, a `ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together` exception is thrown.\n\n## Example: Scalar and Array\n\n```python\na = np.array([1, 2, 3])\nb = 2\nprint(a * b) # [2, 4, 6]\n```\nHere, the scalar `2` is conceptually \"stretched\" to match the shape of `a`.\n\n## Example: Matrix and Vector\n\n```python\nA = np.ones((3, 3))\nb = np.arange(3)\nprint(A + b)\n```\n`b` (shape (3,)) is broadcast across each row of `A` (shape (3, 3)).",
