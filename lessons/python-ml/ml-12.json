  "content": "# Pandas Series\n\nA Series is a one-dimensional array-like object containing a sequence of values and an associated array of data labels, called its index.\n\n## Creating a Series\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# From list\ns = pd.Series([1, 3, 5, np.nan, 6, 8])\n\n# From dictionary (keys become index)\nd = {'a': 0., 'b': 1., 'c': 2.}\ns2 = pd.Series(d)\n```\n\n## Accessing Data\n\nYou can access data by position or by label.\n\n```python\nprint(s2['a'])  # By label\nprint(s2[0])    # By position\n```\n\n## Vectorized Operations\n\nLike NumPy arrays, Series support vectorized operations.\n\n```python\nprint(s2 * 2)\nprint(np.exp(s2))\n```\n\n## Alignment\n\nOperations between Series automatically align the data based on the label. This is a key feature of Pandas.",
