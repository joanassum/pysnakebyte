  "content": "## Correlation vs. Covariance\n\nBoth correlation and covariance measure the relationship and the dependency between two variables.\n\n### Covariance\n\nCovariance indicates the direction of the linear relationship between variables.\n- **Positive Covariance**: Both variables move in the same direction.\n- **Negative Covariance**: Variables move in opposite directions.\n\nHowever, covariance is not standardized, meaning its magnitude depends on the scale of the variables.\n\n### Correlation\n\nCorrelation is a standardized measure of the strength and direction of the linear relationship. The most common metric is Pearson's Correlation Coefficient ($r$), which ranges from -1 to 1.\n\n- $r = 1$: Perfect positive correlation\n- $r = -1$: Perfect negative correlation\n- $r = 0$: No linear correlation\n\n### In Machine Learning\n\nFeature selection often involves removing highly correlated features (multicollinearity) to improve model performance and interpretability.\n",
