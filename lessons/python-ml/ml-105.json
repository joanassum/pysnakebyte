Here are some parting tips.\n\n### Best Practices\n\n1.  **Data First**: The quality of data is more important than the complexity of the algorithm. \"Garbage In, Garbage Out\".\n2.  **Start Simple**: Always start with a simple baseline (e.g., Logistic Regression) before moving to complex models.\n3.  **Cross-Validation**: Always use CV to estimate model performance reliably.\n4.  **Reproducibility**: Fix random seeds (`random_state=42`) and version your data and code.\n5.  **Monitor**: Models degrade over time (data drift). Set up monitoring.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1.  **Deep Learning**: Dive deeper into TensorFlow/PyTorch, CNNs for Vision, Transformers for NLP.\n2.  **MLOps**: Learn about ML pipelines (Airflow, Kubeflow, MLflow).\n3.  **Kaggle**: Participate in competitions to learn from the community.\n4.  **Read Papers**: Stay updated with ArXiv.\n",
