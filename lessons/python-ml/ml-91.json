  "content": "## Introduction to Neural Networks\n\nArtificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains.\n\n### The Biological Neuron\n\n*   **Dendrites**: Receive signals from other neurons.\n*   **Soma (Cell Body)**: Processes the signals.\n*   **Axon**: Transmits the signal to other neurons.\n*   **Synapse**: The connection between the axon of one neuron and the dendrite of another.\n\n### The Artificial Neuron (Perceptron)\n\nAn artificial neuron attempts to mimic this structure:\n1.  **Inputs ($X$)**: Like dendrites, receive data.\n2.  **Weights ($W$)**: Determine the importance of each input.\n3.  **Summation Function**: Calculates the weighted sum ($z = \\sum w_i x_i + b$).\n4.  **Activation Function**: Determines if the neuron \"fires\" (output).\n\n### Layers\n\n*   **Input Layer**: Receives the initial data.\n*   **Hidden Layers**: Intermediate layers where the magic happens.\n*   **Output Layer**: Produces the final result.\n\nDeep Learning essentially refers to Neural Networks with many hidden layers.\n",
