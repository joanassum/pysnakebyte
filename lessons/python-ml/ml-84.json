It also marks as outliers the points that are in low-density regions.\n\n### Key Parameters\n\n*   **eps (epsilon)**: The maximum distance between two samples for one to be considered as in the neighborhood of the other.\n*   **min_samples**: The number of samples (or total weight) in a neighborhood for a point to be considered as a core point.\n\n### Advantages over K-Means\n\n1.  Does not require specifying the number of clusters $K$ beforehand.\n2.  Can find arbitrarily shaped clusters (not just spherical like K-Means).\n3.  Robust to outliers (noise).\n\n### Implementation\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN\n\ndbscan = DBSCAN(eps=0.3, min_samples=5)\ny_dbscan = dbscan.fit_predict(X)\n\n# -1 label represents noise/outliers\n```\n",
