  "content": "## Complex Numbers (`complex`)\n\nPython is one of the few languages that supports complex numbers as a built-in data type. A complex number has a real part and an imaginary part.\n\nIn mathematics, the imaginary unit is often denoted by `i` (where $i^2 = -1$). In Python (and electrical engineering), it is denoted by `j`.\n\n### Creating Complex Numbers\n\n```python\n# Direct notation\nz1 = 3 + 4j\n\n# using complex() constructor\nz2 = complex(3, 4)\n\nprint(z1 == z2)  # True\n```\n\n### Accessing Parts\n\nYou can access the real and imaginary parts using `.real` and `.imag` attributes.\n\n```python\nz = 2 + 5j\nprint(z.real)  # 2.0\nprint(z.imag)  # 5.0\n```\n\nNote that both parts are stored as floats.\n\n### Operations\n\nComplex numbers support standard arithmetic operations.\n\n```python\na = 1 + 2j\nb = 3 + 4j\n\nprint(a + b)  # (4+6j)\nprint(a * b)  # (-5+10j)\n```\n\n### Conjugate\n\nThe conjugate of a complex number has the same real part but an imaginary part with the opposite sign. It is accessible via the `.conjugate()` method.\n\n```python\nz = 3 + 4j\nprint(z.conjugate())  # (3-4j)\n```\n\n### Common Mistakes\n\n- **Spacing**: `1 + j` is invalid syntax. It must be `1 + 1j`. The `j` must follow a number immediately.\n- **Modulo/Floor Division**: Operations like `%` and `//` are not defined for complex numbers and will raise a `TypeError`.\n\n### Applications\n\nComplex numbers are heavily used in scientific computing, engineering (signal processing), and physics (quantum mechanics).\n",
