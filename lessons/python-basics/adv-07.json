  "content": "## Regular Expressions\n\nRegular expressions (regex) are a powerful tool for various kinds of string manipulation. They are a domain-specific language (DSL) that is present as a library in most modern programming languages, not just Python.\n\n### The `re` Module\n\n```python\nimport re\n\npattern = r\"^Hello\"\nstring = \"Hello World\"\nresult = re.match(pattern, string)\n```\n\n### Common Functions\n\n- `re.match()`: Checks for a match only at the beginning of the string.\n- `re.search()`: Checks for a match anywhere in the string.\n- `re.findall()`: Returns a list of all matches.\n- `re.sub()`: Replaces matches with a string.\n\n### Metacharacters\n\n- `.`: Matches any character except newline.\n- `^`: Matches start of the string.\n- `$`: Matches end of the string.\n- `*`: Matches 0 or more repetitions.\n- `+`: Matches 1 or more repetitions.\n- `?`: Matches 0 or 1 repetition.\n- `[]`: Matches a set of characters.\n- `|`: Matches either or.\n- `()`: Groups regular expressions.\n",
