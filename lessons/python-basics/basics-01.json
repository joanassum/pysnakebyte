  "content": "## What is Python?\n\nPython is a high-level, interpreted programming language created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It emphasizes code readability and simplicity, making it an excellent choice for beginners and experienced programmers alike.\n\n## Why Learn Python?\n\nPython has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world for several compelling reasons:\n\n### 1. Easy to Learn and Read\n\nPython's syntax is designed to be intuitive and mirrors natural language in many ways:\n\n```python\n# Python reads almost like English\nif temperature > 30:\n    print(\"It's a hot day!\")\nelse:\n    print(\"It's not too hot.\")\n```\n\n### 2. Versatile Applications\n\nPython is used across many domains:\n\n- **Web Development** - Django, Flask, FastAPI\n- **Data Science** - Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib\n- **Machine Learning** - TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn\n- **Automation** - Scripts, bots, task automation\n- **Game Development** - Pygame\n- **Desktop Applications** - Tkinter, PyQt\n\n### 3. Large Community and Ecosystem\n\nPython has a massive community with over 400,000 packages available on PyPI (Python Package Index).\n\n```python\n# Using external packages is simple\nimport requests\n\nresponse = requests.get(\"https://api.example.com/data\")\nprint(response.json())\n```\n\n## Python's Philosophy\n\nPython follows a set of guiding principles known as \"The Zen of Python\":\n\n```python\nimport this\n```\n\nSome key principles:\n\n- **Beautiful is better than ugly**\n- **Simple is better than complex**\n- **Readability counts**\n- **There should be one obvious way to do it**\n\n## Python 2 vs Python 3\n\nPython 3 is the current and actively developed version. Python 2 reached end-of-life on January 1, 2020. Always use Python 3 for new projects.\n\n```python\n# Python 3 syntax\nprint(\"Hello, World!\")  # Function call with parentheses\n\n# Python 2 syntax (deprecated)\n# print \"Hello, World\"  # Statement without parentheses\n```",
  "code": "# Welcome to Python!\n# Let's see the Zen of Python - Python's guiding principles\n\nimport this\n\n# Python is known for its readable syntax\n# Here's a simple example:\n\nmessage = \"Hello, Python!\"\nprint(message)\n\n# Python can do math easily\nresult = 10 + 20\nprint(\"10 + 20 =\", result)"
