  "content": "## What Are Tuples?\n\nTuples are ordered, **immutable** sequences. Once created, they cannot be changed. They are similar to lists but defined with parentheses `()` instead of square brackets `[]`.\n\n### Creating Tuples\n\n```python\npoint = (10, 20)\ncolors = (\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\")\n```\n\n### The Singleton Tuple Trap\n\nTo create a tuple with a single element, you **must** include a comma. Without it, Python treats it as a parenthesized expression.\n\n```python\nsingle = (1,)   # Tuple\nnumber = (1)    # Integer\n```\n\n### Packing and Unpacking\n\nTuples support a feature called packing and unpacking, which is very idiomatic in Python.\n\n```python\n# Packing\ncoordinates = 10, 20, 30  # Parentheses are optional\n\n# Unpacking\nx, y, z = coordinates\nprint(x)  # 10\n```\n\n### When to Use Tuples?\n\n1.  **Fixed Data**: Use tuples for data that shouldn't change (e.g., months of the year, geographic coordinates).\n2.  **Dictionary Keys**: Tuples are hashable (if they contain only immutable items) and can be used as dictionary keys. Lists cannot.\n3.  **Return Values**: Functions often return multiple values as tuples.\n\n### Common Mistakes\n\n- **Attempting modification**: `t[0] = 5` raises `TypeError`. But remember, if a tuple contains a mutable object (like a list), that object *can* be modified.\n\n```python\nt = ([1, 2], 3)\nt[0].append(3)  # This works! t becomes ([1, 2, 3], 3)\n```\n",
