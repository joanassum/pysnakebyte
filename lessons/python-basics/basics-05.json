  "content": "## Why Use Comments?\n\nComments are notes in your code that Python ignores. They help:\n\n- Explain what your code does\n- Make code easier to understand\n- Document your thought process\n- Help others (and future you) read your code\n\n## Single-Line Comments\n\nUse the hash symbol `#` for single-line comments:\n\n```python\n# This is a comment\nprint(\"Hello\")  # This is an inline comment\n\n# Calculate the area of a rectangle\nwidth = 10\nheight = 5\narea = width * height  # width times height\n```\n\n## Multi-Line Comments\n\nPython doesn't have a dedicated multi-line comment syntax. Use multiple `#` symbols:\n\n```python\n# This is a longer comment\n# that spans multiple lines.\n# Each line needs its own hash symbol.\n\nprint(\"Code continues here\")\n```\n\n### Using Triple Quotes (Docstrings)\n\nTriple quotes can also work as multi-line comments:\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThis is a multi-line string.\nWhen not assigned to a variable,\nit acts like a comment.\n\"\"\"\n\nprint(\"This code runs normally\")\n```\n\n## Docstrings: Documentation Strings\n\nDocstrings are special comments for documenting functions, classes, and modules:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_area(length, width):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the area of a rectangle.\n    \n    Args:\n        length: The length of the rectangle\n        width: The width of the rectangle\n        \n    Returns:\n        The area as a number\n    \"\"\"\n    return length * width\n\n# Access the docstring\nprint(calculate_area.__doc__)\n```\n\n## Good vs Bad Comments\n\n### Good Comments\n\n```python\n# Calculate compound interest using the formula A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\nprincipal = 1000\nrate = 0.05\ntime = 10\ncompound_frequency = 12\n\n# Note: rate is annual, convert to monthly\nmonthly_rate = rate / compound_frequency\n```\n\n### Bad Comments (Obvious/Redundant)\n\n```python\n# Set x to 5\nx = 5  # assign 5 to x\n\n# Add 1 to counter\ncounter = counter + 1\n\n# Loop through the list\nfor item in items:\n    pass\n```",
  "code": "# Comments in Python - Examples\n\n# Single-line comment - Python ignores this\n\nprint(\"Hello!\")  # Inline comment - also ignored\n\n# This is a multi-line comment\n# explaining what the code below does.\n# Each line starts with a hash.\n\n# Calculate the average of three test scores\ntest1 = 85\ntest2 = 90\ntest3 = 78\n\n# Sum all scores and divide by count\naverage = (test1 + test2 + test3) / 3\nprint(f\"Average score: {average}\")\n\n\"\"\"\nThis is a docstring.\nIt's often used for multi-line comments\nor documentation strings.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef greet(name):\n    \"\"\"Display a greeting to the user.\n    \n    Args:\n        name: The name of the person to greet\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n\n# Call the function\ngreet(\"Python Learner\")\n\n# TODO: Add more examples here\n# FIXME: Remember to handle edge cases"
